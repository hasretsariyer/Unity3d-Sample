- Create Multibranch Pipeline on Jenkins
- If you choose not to discover all the branches from the repo, you can opt for the regular expression or wildcard method to discover branches from the repo as shown below.

- install unity3d plugin
- Configure Webhook For Multibranch Pipeline (Github-Add Webhook-send me eveything)
- Expose a local web server to the internet (download ngrok, add github webhook) 
- Install Generic Webhook Trigger Plugin
- Jenkins then needs to be configured for each installed version of Unity: Jenkins -> Manage Jenkins -> Global Tool Configuration -> Unity3d -> Unity3d installationsâ€¦
